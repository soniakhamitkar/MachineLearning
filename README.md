# **Machine Learning Projects**

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms using **R** and **Quarto**. Each project includes code, explanations, and visualizations to demonstrate key concepts in supervised and unsupervised learning.

## **Contents**  

### ðŸ“Œ Supervised Learning  
- **Linear & Logistic Regression** â€“ Implementing regression models for prediction and classification.  
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** â€“ Applying kNN for both classification and regression tasks.  
- **Classification and Regression Trees (CART)** â€“ Decision tree-based modeling for predictive analysis.  
- **Neural Networks** â€“ Training and evaluating neural network models for complex pattern recognition.  
- **NaÃ¯ve Bayes** â€“ Probabilistic classification using Bayesâ€™ theorem.  
- **Ensemble Methods**  
  - Boosting  
  - Bagging  
  - Random Forest  

### ðŸ“Œ Unsupervised Learning  
- **Clustering**  
  - K-Means  
  - Hierarchical Clustering  

Each folder contains **Quarto (.qmd) files** with step-by-step explanations, code implementations, and results.
