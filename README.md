# MachineLearningProjects
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms using R and Quarto. Each project includes code, explanations, and visualizations to demonstrate key concepts in supervised and unsupervised learning.

Contents
ðŸ“Œ Supervised Learning
Linear & Logistic Regression â€“ Implementing regression models for prediction and classification.
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) â€“ Applying kNN for both classification and regression tasks.
Classification and Regression Trees (CART) â€“ Decision tree-based modeling for predictive analysis.
Neural Networks â€“ Training and evaluating neural network models for complex pattern recognition.
NaÃ¯ve Bayes â€“ Probabilistic classification using Bayesâ€™ theorem.
Ensemble Methods â€“ Boosting, Bagging, and Random Forest to improve model accuracy.

ðŸ“Œ Unsupervised Learning
Clustering â€“ Implementing K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for data segmentation.

Each folder contains Quarto (.qmd) files with step-by-step explanations, code implementations, and results.
